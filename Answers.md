GitHub helps scientists follow the best practices for scientific computing in many ways. First it makes it easier for 
  scientists to record changes and find previous changes. In addition, the branch feature helps scientists ensure that the 
  master file only contains the code that actually works and allows researchers to experiment with different lines of code.
  Finally it allows for open collaboration with other GitHub users by allowing people to merge their code with others.
